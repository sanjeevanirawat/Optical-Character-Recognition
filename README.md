# Optical-character-Recognition

This Optical character Recognition allows users to upload a single image, processes the image(containing hindi or english texts) to extract text using OCR, and provides a basic search word feature.
The project required setting up a development environment and essential libraries. This included installing dependencies such as pytesseract, Pillow, numpy, opencv-python-headless, and Tesseract itself.
Tessract installation is  Configured locally or in the virtual environment.
Images were pre-processed (e.g., grayscale conversion, contrast adjustment) using OpenCV and NumPy to enhance OCR accuracy.
pytesseract extracted text in both English and Hindi by specifying the language configuration (eng+hin).
Error handling ensured smooth execution.
Keyword search feature allowed users to search for specific words in the extracted text, with results highlighted using Streamlitâ€™s markdown.
Built with Streamlit, offering a simple UI for uploading images, viewing text, and searching keywords.
Custom CSS styling created a visually appealing experience.
